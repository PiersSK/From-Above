  - This is LSC world news
  - Reports from the world council suggest that tensions
  - across the Federation and Telostate Union border are winding down.
  - As further information is revealed about the justification for hostilities intensifying,
  - and separate inquiries revealing these largely ungrounded,
  - calls for peace from other world leaders underscore scenes of violence
  - against small groups of protesting citizens on both sides of the border wall.
  - The fate of disarmament talks scheduled for this afternoon are still uncertain,
  - and the existence of the controversial RAPIER program
  - is still being officially denied by Federation Leadership.
